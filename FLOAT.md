# M4 — floating point: design

Plan for adding floating-point arithmetic to UPLNC. Status/tracking lives in
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); this is the design and slice breakdown.

## Scope decisions

- **x86_64 / SSE2 first.** Doubles live in `%xmm` registers; arithmetic is
  `addsd`/`subsd`/`mulsd`/`divsd`. i386's x87 FPU stack is painful and is
  **deferred** — on i386 the FP paths emit a clean "float not supported on
  i386 yet" error.
- **`double` first** (8 bytes). `float` (4 bytes, `movss`/`cvtss2sd`) is a later
  slice.
- **The compiler stays integer-only.** It never does float arithmetic itself, so
  the **self-host bootstrap is unaffected** (the FP codegen paths simply go
  unexercised when compiling the float-free compiler — i386 and x86_64 self-host
  exactly as before).

## The key trick: the assembler computes the bits

The integer-only compiler can't evaluate `1.5` into IEEE-754. It doesn't need to:
it stores the literal **as text** and emits `.double 1.5` into `.rodata`, letting
**gas** compute the bit pattern. The compiler only ever copies/loads 8-byte
blobs. So float literals need a text pool, not float math.

## Codegen model (x86_64)

- **FP accumulator = `%xmm0`** (parallel to the integer accumulator `%rax`).
- **FP temporaries** spill to the stack: `subq $8,%rsp; movsd %xmm0,(%rsp)` /
  `movsd (%rsp),%xmm1; addq $8,%rsp` (mirrors the integer push/pop).
- **Load/store** doubles with `movsd` (local: `n(%rbp)`, global: `sym`, literal:
  `.LFn` in `.rodata`).
- **Conversions**: `cvttsd2si %xmm0,%rax` (double→int), `cvtsi2sd %rax,%xmm0`
  (int→double).
- **Compare**: `ucomisd` + `setcc` (+ unordered handling later).

Codegen is **type-routed**: the existing dispatch points (`getmem`, the store
paths, `loadnum`, the `ct_*` binary-op handlers, `return`) gain a `T_DOUBLE`
branch that emits the FP form. New `CD_*` opcodes carry the FP operations; only
`cd_write_x86_64` lowers them (i386 errors).

## Calling convention (SysV, later slice)

Doubles are passed in `%xmm0–7` (a separate sequence from the integer
`%rdi–r9`), the return value is in `%xmm0`, and a variadic call (`printf("%f")`)
must set `%al` = number of vector registers used. This extends the marshaling
(`CD_MARSHAL`/`CD_SPILLARGS`) with a parallel xmm track — it is the trickiest
slice and is sequenced after scalar FP works.

## Slices (each verified; i386 self-host stays byte-identical throughout)

1. **Literal → int.** Lex `double` literals; add `T_DOUBLE`; load a double
   literal into `%xmm0`; convert to int at a return. Test: `return 42.0;` → exit
   42. *(This slice — the minimal end-to-end path.)*
2. **Locals + arithmetic.** `var double:x;` load/store (`movsd`); `+ - * /` via
   the xmm push/pop pattern; double→int return. Test: `x=20.0+22.0; return x;`.
3. **Conversions + mixed.** int↔double at assignment/return; usual arithmetic
   conversions for `1.5 + 2`.
4. **Calling convention.** double params (`%xmm0–7`), return double, and
   `printf("%f", x)` (xmm + `%al`). Validated by stdout.
5. **Globals + `float`.** global doubles; the 4-byte `float` type.
6. **i386 x87** *(optional)* — only if i386 FP is wanted.

## Testing

Scalar slices (1–3) are validated by **exit code** (convert the double result to
int and return it). The calling-convention slice (4) is validated by **stdout**
(`printf("%f", …)`). All go in `transpiler/tests/progs/` and run on the x86_64
CI job; i386 self-host fixpoints confirm the compiler is unchanged.
